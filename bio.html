	My name is Emily, and I'm from Norwich, Vermont. I am studying Electrical Engineering at Tufts University in Medford, MA. Given my passion for the environment, I'm interested in applying my engineering knowledge to the field of renewable energy. I am currently a Software & Electrical Engineering Intern at Ivys Energy Solutions at Greentown Labs in Somerville, MA. Prior to Ivys, I worked as a summer intern at Solaflect Energy, a solar company in Norwich, VT.
