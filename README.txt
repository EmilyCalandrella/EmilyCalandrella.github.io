Comp 20 Lab 4
All aspects of this assignment have been implemented sucessfully; I created my three HTML files with CSS files to go along with them. The files pass the official validations and follow the specifications described in the assignment instructions.
I did not collaborate with anyone on this lab.
I spent approximately six hours on this lab. A lot of that time was watching YoutTube videos to help me understand the relationship between html files, css files, and Github.
